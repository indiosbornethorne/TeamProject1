For this section I will be writing it (Indi). I decided to take up the role of setting up our website and git repository as I enjoyed it a lot on Assignment 1. I felt confident in my ability to do this efficiently and make sure it would be all good to go come due date. I also took this role because I wanted us to have a website setup early into the assignment, this was based on my look into our test results which showed the majority of us were visual learners. Since I know I work better when I can see my progress I thought that my other team members with the same learning style as me would feel the same. My team was happy to give me this role. I also ensured that everyone had a link to the repository early on incase they wanted to make any changes themselves.
            <br>
            <br>
I made this website on a base of my personal profile (link above), and changed it to fit this project as it was bigger. The main things I cahanged to accomidate this was: Changing it from a single page website to a multi page website, making use of headers more to seperate sections on pages, a new navigation bar compared to my original one, different colour scheme.

Your comments on how well the audit trail on the Git repository reflects your groupâ€™s
work. You will presumably only be able to do this close to the time of submission.
<br>
<br>
As I said before, I setup the website for the group. Therefore I did all the pushes. Each push I did I said what we had added to website, so if you follow the log you can see it all piece together nicely.

             <p style="margin-left: 1%">

 As a group we communicated through <b>Discord</b>. 
<br>
<br>
Discord is an application that can be accessed via the web or the app itself, which allows you to create communication servers with text and voice channels. This allowed us to make rooms for different purposes and chats, and since the application is used by most of us for personal use, it meant we were already familiar with the application which meant utilising it was easy.
