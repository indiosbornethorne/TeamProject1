work. You will presumably only be able to do this close to the time of submission.

    <b>REPORT 1 - Clouds, Services, Servers</b>
         <p style="margin-left: 1%">
             
The cloud describes the concept of cloud computing. The cloud is the process of running any application or service on your phone, computer, server, etc. in which this application or service is hosted offsite by a collection of computers which they host to your device. E.g. The same way that a real cloud has a dense number of water molecules, but to us just appears to look like a cloud, cloud computing is a dense cluster of computers working together so to the user they appear to be one computing resource on their device.
        <br>
        <br>
So what does that mean for us? This cluster of computers is able to share resources with each other, which in turn, allows users, for example to purchase a few GB of cloud storage without having to purchase a USB, host multiple servers without the need to set them up, maintain them or worry about what to do with them once you do not need them. It also allows you to spread your money out as purchasing hardware means an upfront cost, cloud computing could charge you monthly. It also eliminates the need to be able and have the skillset, to setup raids and ftp servers to host your own servers, say if you were in a business environment.
        <br>
        <br>
Along with the cloud comes a lot of services in which has become available only with the resources and the concept of cloud computing. Some of these services are:
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
<b>VMware</b>
        <br>
        <br>
Perform software emulation on virtual machines. Allows virtual computers to be hosted on the computer, this could be one or multiple. This allows different OS platforms, applications, etc. Kernel mode is the hardware Implementation. These virtual machine applications are hosted by a company in which they give you the details of the machine which you can then remote into.  This eliminates the need to go out and purchase hardware just to run a machine, and gives more flexibility with a lower cost when it comes to running multiple machines with ease.
        <br>
        <br>
Dropbox
Dropbox is an example of a cloud storage option. Cloud storage lets you purchase storage which you would pay monthly. You can purchase any amount of storage big or small and you can upgrade or downgrade at any time. Dropbox works by having a huge amount of storage onsite in which they then setup raids and ftp servers to host them online which users can then purchase and access. This eliminates the need to go out and buy storage or not know what to do with storage if you have too much. You also do not run the risk of losing your data as they would have storage all over the world with backups if anything happens.
        <br>
        <br>
Github
Github which we now all know is also a great example of a cloud application. Git is an open source distributed version control system. That allows collaboration of files and website hosting. Github allows you to setup a repository which is basically a central file system, you and anyone else you want can then clone this repository to your local drive and then pull changes from others from the repository, commit your changes, push your updates to the repository, and then other members pull your changes from the repository. This service has huge benefits and really takes advantage of the power of the cloud.
        <br>
        <br>
These are just some examples, a few extras to note are Gmail, Spotify and Netflix which most of us probably use everyday, these are all cloud based services. As you can see the cloud is probably bigger than you thought, it constantly evolving with startups everyday.
        <br>
        <br>
The Impact that the cloud has depends on your involvement in it. The cloud can be categorized into 3 categories which everyone can fit into at least one. These three main categories are: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS.
        <br>
        <br>
IsaaS
Infrastructure as a service. Cloud based infrastructure resources that deliver to organisations via computer virtualisation to help manage servers, networks, OSs, and data storage. This of course makes a huge impact on IT in business and therefore businesses as a whole as the cloud creates a lot of efficiency, easy maintenance, lower cost, scalability, support teams and recovery options.
        <br>
        <br>
PaaS
Platform as a service. Cloud based platform services that provide developers with a framework they can use to create applications on. This is an example of providing an online platform that is accessible to developers over the internet. PaaS gives developers more options to create their work and a suitable environment to test on.
        <br>
        <br>
SaaS
SaaS stands for software as a service.  Cloud based software that is hosted online. This is software that is hosted online, this differs from PaaS as SaaS allows users to use a companies software online and PaaS is used to create applications and host them to test them (after they are created they would be considered SaaS). An easy way to explain this functionality is with examples such as dropbox and google suite. Both these resources give you a service that acts as an app, but instead of having to download it you can access all the functions online and the hardware that hosts it is again offsite.
        <br>
        <br>
The potential impact of clouds, services, and servers is to create faster, more reliable, cheaper options. This is all evolving with technology and as new technology is created, old technologies becomes redundant, but their prices drop. This makes all of this very likely to occur and will impact every business that uses cloud computing. This advancement of technology will impact data centers and the communication lines between businesses and data centers, The data centers that host online services for everyday users, and bandwidth capabilities for people to access these services.I do not believe cloud technology will make any jobs redundant, in contrast, I believe this will open up a lot of job opportunities as more businesses adopt the cloud and more data centers need to be created and staffed.
        <br>
        <br>
This technology affects me everyday as I work in a corporate environment in an IT team that uses multiple cloud resources such as VMware, Mimecast, Data Center server hosting, etc. Before this course I did not know how important cloud technology was and looking over our current system I am relieved that so much of it is based on the cloud which makes our lives easier. As this technology progresses it will of course make our jobs easier and speed up user experience which in turn works for everyone. 
        <br>
        <br>
Cloud computing affects my family everyday as they access so many cloud based programs such as Netflix, Spotify, Facebook, etc. They might not know they are even using the cloud but that is what a lot of IT fundamentals are, everything is run in the background and a lot of the time will go unnoticed. The cloud is clearly an important piece of technology.
