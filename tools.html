For this section I will be writing it (Indi). My role for Assignment 2 involved working on the website and git repository again as I enjoyed it a lot on Assignment 1 and Assignment 2. I felt confident in my ability to do this efficiently and make sure it would be all good to go come due date. Last assignment I decided to setup the website early so we could keep track of where we were up to, this time however since we had already done the majority of the website, we decided to do it last and focus on the report. With this approach it simply meant putting all our new work into our website at the end.

As I said before, I setup the website for the group. Therefore I did all the pushes. Each push I did I tried to state what I had worked on for reference. Following the commit trail you can see each part of the website come together nicely. If I was to do this again I would try be a bit more specific but it is a bit hard with the chatacter limit.

            <b>Group Communication</b>
             <p style="margin-left: 1%">

 As a group we communicated through <b>Discord</b>. 
<br>
<br>
Discord is an application that can be accessed via the web or the app itself, which allows you to create communication servers with text and voice channels. This allowed us to make rooms for different purposes and chats, and since the application is used by most of us for personal use, it meant we were already familiar with the application which meant utilising it was easy.
