    <h2>Personal Group Reflections</h2>

    <b>Manuel:</b>
I like working with this group. I think that we are all on the same head space because we know what we are working for and what we are trying to achieved. I like that we don’t get into any conflict which would have affected our group dynamics. The group work smoothly and each has contributed and work according to each strength. 
<br>
<br>
If there’s something that could be improved in our group maybe we should be a little more organize to find time together. Although, it may not have affected how we go through this assignment, having time together may have benefitted us. We could probably use voice as well when we are having discussion instead of just messaging.
<br>
<br>
The one thing I found surprising is how easy it is to work with this group. This is in spite of the fact that we are completely a stranger with each other. But the rapport we have achieved and the ease of working together is a good experience. I’m glad and very lucky to have chosen to work with this bunch.
<br>
<br>
The one thing I learned about groups is that no matter if you’re not physically together in the same space, you can still work together smoothly and achieve the best outcome.
<br>
<br>
<b>Indi:</b> Everyone contributed and pulled their weight and I dont think there was any tension or grudges about the amount of work each member was doing. This I feel is pretty rare in group work. I am also impressed by the level of work from all members, I did not feel I needed to go in any change anything people had done.
<br>
<br>
Next time how we can improve is to have more group meetings. We were all pretty active on Discord, and when someone was not on they would always go back and read what they missed, but next time it would be great if we could have set meetings so we can discuss as a group in the moment. This could lead to us creating polls and what not so we all get an opinion on matters.
<br>
<br>      
I was surprised that I was not very stressed during this project, it was probably the most smooth team project I have done. Previously I have been stressed with work load, conflict of ideas, etc. But I felt none of this during this project. Great team :)
<br>
<br>
What I learned from group works is that a good communication platform is key! As I really enjoyed using Discord and the familiarity of it was very nice. I also learned that group work can be fun and with a good team it can go very smoothly.
