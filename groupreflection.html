            <h2>Group Reflection</h2> 
      
        
            <p style="margin-left: 1%">

As a group, we were extremely fortunate to find that our personalities meshed quite well together and that we had group members with the skills required to complete the project. Something that surprised most of our group was the ease at which we got along once we had broken the. The consensus among us is that we all worked quite well together as a unit and that discord was an excellent way to communicate with each other as it allowed 24/7 messaging and has message history and search options. The lack of conflict in our team contributed to a good group work experience for all members, some of whom are participating in their first group assignment and others whom have worked in teams before and have remarked on our exceptional cohesion.<br><br>
Members have expressed that our group was well structured with clearly defined goals and that our communication was adequate. Some have suggested, however, that voice communication and a more defined meeting schedule may benefit our organisational skills as well as provide clearer direction and defined roles. Given this, there was some confusion early on as to who was doing what, but it was resolved by the appropriate delegation of tasks.<br><br>
This group had to manage this assignment with full time work and other important life commitments and has done so admirably, always submitting work ahead of time and working hard to meet the requirements. The obvious exception is Liza. As has probably become apparent from our individual reflections, the consensus is that if she had not intended to complete the work, she should not have offered to take on responsibility. Nor should she have joined over a week into work on the assignment in the first place. If we must re-form or recruit new members for a future assignment, I think all of us will be wary of handing off important tasks to members who join late and/or are not as responsive as the others. In addition, for future group work, we have decided to keep a rolling bibliography rather than doing individual ones at the end of the project so that members can post information sources as they work. Not only does this ensure proper citations but will allow much faster sharing of information.
<br><br>
We all learned that it is possible to have a fun and enjoyable group work experience if the people involved are willing to put in the effort and be as personable as they can.

I like working with this group. I think that we are all on the same head space because we know what we are working for and what we are trying to achieved. I like that we don’t get into any conflict which would have affected our group dynamics. The group work smoothly and each has contributed and work according to each strength. 
<br>
<br>
If there’s something that could be improved in our group maybe we should be a little more organize to find time together. Although, it may not have affected how we go through this assignment, having time together may have benefitted us. We could probably use voice as well when we are having discussion instead of just messaging.
<br>
<br>
The one thing I found surprising is how easy it is to work with this group. This is in spite of the fact that we are completely a stranger with each other. But the rapport we have achieved and the ease of working together is a good experience. I’m glad and very lucky to have chosen to work with this bunch.
<br>
<br>
The one thing I learned about groups is that no matter if you’re not physically together in the same space, you can still work together smoothly and achieve the best outcome.

This I feel is pretty rare in group work. I am also impressed by the level of work from all members, I did not feel I needed to go in any change anything people had done. 
<br>
<br>
Next time how we can improve is to have more group meetings. We were all pretty active on Discord, and when someone was not on, they would always go back and read what they missed, but next time it would be great if we could have set meetings so we can discuss as a group in the moment. This could lead to us creating polls and what not, so we all get an opinion on matters.

I was surprised that I was not very stressed during this project, it was probably the most smooth team project I have done. Previously I have been stressed with work load, conflict of ideas, etc. But I felt none of this during this project. Great team :)

What I learned from group works is that a good communication platform is key! As I really enjoyed using Discord and the familiarity of it was very nice. I also learned that group work can be fun and with a good team it can go very smoothly.

 I was extremely nervous about doing group work, but despite my reservations this group went very smoothly, and everyone contributed where they could and what they were asked to. We used a discord server that I set up to communicate and share ideas and files for proof reading. Early in the formation of our group we decided to delegate tasks to members with skillset’s specific to the requirements. I also tried to step into a leadership role when I realised that I had the motivation and the time to do so, and the group responded well to my attempts to organise and give directions and I’m glad that I didn’t come off as an authoritarian. The only real disappointment was with Liza, our 5th group member, who joined a week late and asked to be given some responsibility, only to then vanish and never communicate again. She was frequently online in Discord but never responded to mentions or direct messages. I am satisfied with the quality of the work we have done and look forward to potentially working in the same group again.

I felt as though everyone in the group worked incredibly well together with the exception of Liza unfortunately as they stopped replying to us, so it is assumed they aren’t in the group. In my opinion everyone contributed as much as they could considering people have other things going on in their lives such as full-time jobs, or families to look after or simply they may have become ill. We worked well using a discord chat to share ideas, to share work and have a chat. It was advantageous to work like this as we were able to proofread each other’s work and plan how we would complete the assignment. This method allowed each of our individual traits and skills to shine through and compliment one another.
<br>
<br>
Personally, I felt I also worked well and contributed what was required to complete the assignment. I too had to manage the assignment with other commitments also but attempted to respond in group chats as much as I could and give my opinion on how the assignment was going to be completed. I look forward to working with this group again as we complemented one another well and Im sure that will lead to a successful assignment.
