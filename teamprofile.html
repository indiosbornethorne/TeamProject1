            <br>
Hello, I am Indi Osborne-Thorne. My email is indiosborne@gmail.com and my student number is s3819720. I am a 19 year old Australian. I completed my HSC in 2018 and after a small break, moved to Sydney after getting a entry level IT job at an advertising company. Sadly I have not learnt any other languages beyond English, but as a close second, I have picked up a Canadian accent despite having 0 relation to even an American... I love the rainy season and spending time with my two kittens.

            <br>
My name is Adam Dooley and I am a twenty-five-year-old living in Melbourne’s west. My student number is s38083113 and email address is s38083113@student.rmit.edu.au.I have always had a keen interest in IT and technology in general my entire life and spend my leisure time using a computer, playing video games or engaging in some other sort of tech activity like learning to program or just to simply fiddle with tech. I hope to use this course to gain some more insight into the different aspects of the IT industry so that I can find my niche and potentially specialised in a field.

    <b>Matthew</b>
            <br>
            <br>
My name is Matthew Limbert (Student No:s3818719 Email: s3818719@student.rmit.edu.au), and I have loved using computers all my life. It would be no exaggeration to say that IT is something I am genuinely passionate about. My parents bought our first family computer when I was 5 years old and I was enraptured by the point and click adventure games and side scrollers that were available at the time, around 1996. Ever since then I have been fascinated with their function. I am quite skilled dealing with computer hardware but am looking to improve my software and programming abilities, as-well as seeking a recognizable qualification.

    <b>Manuel</b>
            <br>
            <br>
I am Manuel U Santos (rodeanmanny@hotmail.com), student no s3818723, currently living in Rooty Hill, NSW. I was born and raised in Olongapo City, Philippines and migrated to Australia in April of 1999. I am fluent in both Filipino and English language. I finished my elementary education from Tapinac Elementary School and earned my high school diploma from Columban College. I studied and earned a degree of Doctor of Veterinary Medicine in 1992 from the University of the Phillippines-Los Banos where I eventually worked as an Assistant Professor in Veterinary Microbiology for six years prior to migrating to Australia. I am currently working with Macquarie Bank as an Investigations Consultant. I am a keen gardener and loves to cook and I also love poetry and singing (probably the most famous past time among Filipinos). Personally, I have three reasons why I am interested in IT, fascination, knowledge and future-proofing: Fascination, Knowledge, and Future-Proofing.

             <br>
             <i>1. What do the results of these tests mean for you?</i>
             <br>
             I never knew I was a visual learner, it does make some sense when I think about my current approach to how I study and learn. It is a good thing to know and I will definitely be following some of the tips that the information gives.
             <br>
                <br>
             <i>2. How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</i>
             <br>
             When our team does planning and designing it would be best if we had storyboard or some sort of graphics to support the idea since according to the results that is the best way for me to understand it.
             <br>
                <br>
             <i> 3. How should you take this into account when forming a team?</i>
             <br>
             It would be ideal to form a group in which we all have the same learning style so we all understand and can convey our messages easier to each other.

             <i>1. What do the results of these tests mean for you?</i>
             <br>
             The information that supports my result made me smile, they made points that I felt described me well and made me feel a bit more confident and happy about myself. My favourite piece of information I found was “Adventurers enjoy upsetting traditional expectations with experiments in beauty and behavior – chances are, they’ve expressed more than once the phrase “Don’t box me in!”. I feel like I can relate to this and inspires me to live up to the results of the test.
             <br>
                <br>
             <i>2. How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</i>
             <br>
             The results helped me figure out what I should and should not be doing in team environment. Based on the results I should bring to the team a good range of ideas that are a bit uncommon, and that I should be confident in my ideas not hide them. It also taught me that if I get bad criticism I should be careful on how I react as my personality type can be affected by this criticism different based on the situation.
             <br>
                <br>
             <i>3. How should you take this into account when forming a team?</i>
             <br>
             When forming my team I want give input on our project ideas or try to make someone else's ideas more creative and unique.

             <br>
                <br>
             
             <i>1. What do the results of these tests mean for you?</i>
             <br>
             The points that the results show are all positive which makes me feel proud. I can relate to all the points and I feel like anyone else that knows me would say this is true too. This test also added a interesting point that 12% of the world have these same characteristics. These tests results were also very similar to the ones I recieved in the 16 personalities test which makes them both seem more accurate which is great.
             <br>
                <br>
             <i>2. How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</i>
             <br>
             As long as I stick to these traits I should be perfect in a team environment. It does however say that I am conflict avoidant, which is very true, but would not really help if there is conflict in our team. Therefore if there is conflict I might try step out of my personality a bit to try stop it. But all in all I will take these traits and apply them to our group work.
             <br>
                <br>
             <i>3. How should you take this into account when forming a team?</i>
             <br>
             Hopefully finding some other members that also have some of the key points that I have such as "Practical, thorough, and consistent" and "organized and responsible". Maybe finding another team member that is good at conflict resolution.

<b>Myer Briggs</b>
                <br>
                <br>
  I completed a Myer Briggs personality test on <a href="https://www.16personalities.com" style="color: #ff7878">16personalities.com</a> that showed that I am an INTP-T or Logician.  This a personality type that is know for brilliant theories and unrelenting logic. This personality type is someone that is enthusiastic open minded and straight forward. <br>
                <br>
   However, at the same time they are someone that could appear to be insensitive, private and withdrawn and condescending. These traits are important to note In relation to team work as I am someone who may be enthusiastic about the task at hand and my have valuable ideas and information for the team.<br>
                <br>
    But I may lack the confidence to share the ideas, due to second guessing my ideas or relevancy of points that I would like to bring forward. I am someone that can find it frustrating to convey ideas and explain how my thought process worked, and at times would rather just not give input than trying to offer a clear explanation.<br>
                <br>
     This is crucial when working in teams as it is greatly beneficial in team work to share ideas and hear from different people as this is the basis of innovation. A logician can appear to be someone who is insensitive and this is something that they would need to be aware of when working in teams to ensure that they take other peoples feelings into account when making decisions and generally being aware that not all decisions will be made purely based on logic.
  A logician will positively impact a team as they are imaginative and original people that seek creative ways to solve problems and are sound innovators. They are objective thinkers which ensures they will focus on solving the problem at hand and not stray too far from what is required.<br>
                <br>
   They are people that are honest and straightforward and although in certain situations this could be a boundary for teamwork, it will also allow them to continue with progressing on tasks and keeping things simple.
                <br>
                                <br>

<b>Creativity Test</b>
                <br>
                <br>
  I completed the creativity test at <a href="http://www.testmycreativity.com" style="color: #ff7878">test my creativity.com.</a> The test has listed me as someone that is less creative than that of the average person, however I feel that my creativity flourishes in some environments more so than others and it is affected by factors such as the current task at hand and my interest in the task.<br>
                <br>
   An example of this could be that I have never been an artistic person and always struggled with tasks such as painting and drawing, but I enjoy writing and feel that I can generate some creative ideas when constructing a narrative.  <br>
                <br>
It’s important for me to have this knowledge as I can be aware of my lack of creativity in some situations and it may be beneficial for me and the outcome of a project to seek assistance or advice when working on projects that require an aspect of creativity. <br>
                <br>
 Its important to be aware of this when working in the team as others may thrive when a task demands creativity and for the benefit of the project they could focus on that aspect whereas I could focus on the parts that have a more explicit outline or scope. <br>
                <br>
  When forming team’s creativity is crucial as you would preferably want a mix of individuals who are creative and think outside of the box and others that thrive when following structure and instructions. Having a mix would ensure that projects are creative and unique but at the same time will meet guidelines and perform that objective that is required.

<b>
A personality test</b> taken at <a href="https://psychcentral.com" style="color: #ff7878">https://psychcentral.com</a> suggests that my defining personality traits are a high level of neuroticism and open mindedness. This means that I may be prone to negativity and anxiety but have a high degree of creativity and enjoy the discussion of new ideas. This test also described me as “somewhat organized” which is a fair enough description of me. I tend to approach things from a very organized starting point but because I have ADHD I am easily distracted and end up working on multiple things at once, sometimes to my detriment.

<b>A learning style test</b> taken at <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org" style="color: #ff7878">http://www.educationplanner.org/</a> suggests that my primary learning style is visual. This means that I learn best using visual aids such as pictures and by reading. I remember things by sight and like to close their eyes to visualise or remember something. Spoken directions may prove challenging for a visual learner to follow, and they may be easily distracted by sounds. Visual learners are usually neat and clean, Education Planner has the following suggestions for learners of this style.
                <br>
                <br>

• Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis.<br>
• Use flashcards to learn new words.<br>
• Try to visualize things that you hear or things that are read to you.<br>
• Write down key words, ideas, or instructions.<br>
• Draw pictures to help explain new concepts and then explain the pictures.<br>
• Color code things.<br>
• Avoid distractions during study times.<br>

                <br>
<b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?:</b> In a team situation I have a tendancy to want to follow a clearly defined leader, however if no clear direction is taking place and things seem disorganised I will feel the need to step up and make things happen as a lack of organisation makes me anxious regarding the results.
                <br>
                <br>
<b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?:</b> I need a team that is willing to understand that if I say something that seem blunt I am simply trying to get to the point of the matter and do not mean to be abrasive. I am driven by getting to the clear truth of the matter and value the integrity of my own work and expect the same from others.

<B>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Test Results</B>
                <br>
                <br>
ESTJ is one of the 16 personality types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). ESTJs are often described as practical, take-charge kind of people. David Keirsey, the creator of the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, suggests that approximately eight to twelve percent of all people have an ESTJ personality.
ESTJ Characteristics
                <br>
The MBTI looks at personality preferences in four key areas: 1) Extraversion vs Introversion, 2) Sensing vs Intuition, 3) Thinking vs Feeling and 4) Judging vs Perceiving. As youve probably already guessed, the acronym ESTJ represents Extraversion, Sensing, Thinking and Judging.
<br>
<br>
<b>Etraversion</b>: ESTJs are outgoing and enjoy leading and supervising other people.
<br>
<br>
<b>Sensing</b>: ESTJs enjoy concrete facts as opposed to abstract information.
<br>
<br>
<b>Thinking</b>: ESTJs rely on objective information and logic to make decision rather than personal feelings.
<br>
<br>
<b>Judging</b>: ESTJs like control and order, so they like to plan things well in advance.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Some common ESTJ characteristics include:
                <br>
<br>
Practical and realistic
                <br>

You are a Visual learner! Check out the information below, or view all of the learning styles.
                <br>
<br>
Visual
                <br>
<br>
If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.
                <br>
<br>
As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.
                <br>
<br>
Here are some things that visual learners like you can do to learn better:
<br>
<br>
<br>Sit near the front of the classroom. (It won't mean you're the teacher's pet!)
<br>
<br>Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis.
<br>
<br>Use flashcards to learn new words.
<br>
<br>Try to visualize things that you hear or things that are read to you.
<br>
<br>Write down key words, ideas, or instructions.
<br>
<br>Draw pictures to help explain new concepts and then explain the pictures.
<br>
<br>Color code things.
<br>
<br>Avoid distractions during study times.
                <br>
<br>
Remember that you need to see things, not just hear things, to learn well.

<i>These results just prove what I have known for a long time. There is nothing surprising about these results. I do not think it will influence much on my behavior in a team as it mirrors how I behave currently in a team environment. I would probably make some adjustments in the early days as I start to know my team.</i>

    <h2>Test Evaluation</h2>

<p style="margin-left: 1%">

Looking at our test results at a whole we have some similar aspects and some unique aspects. For learning style, Indi, Matthew and Manuel are all Visual learners. This means that we should all definitely be sending each other our work frequently so the visual learners can get the message better rather than just picturing it or talking about it, for this we should create a website early so we can track progress in a visual view. 
As for personality tests we were all a bit unique as expected.
<br>
<br>
Indi’s results show that he is a bit of an adventurer, that enjoys upsetting traditional expectations with experiments in beauty and behaviour. This could be helpful for us to make our project a bit more creative and enjoyable for the viewer.
<br>
<br>
Adams results show that he is a Logician, this shows that he is know for his brilliant theories and unrelating logic. He can be enthusiastic, open minded and straight forward. It also mentions that the personality type will results in lack of confidence to share ideas. With this information we should let him speak his ideas as he seems to the personality to think of some great content.
<br>
<br>
Matthews results show that he has a logic driven mindset and will work best with goals in mind and a clear organisational heirarchy. He has stated that in a team situation he has the tendancy to want to follow a clearly defined leader, however if no clear direction is taking place and things seem disorganised he will feel the need to step up and make things happen. This show that he will pull his weight where it is needed which is great for a team project, and as a team we should pull our weight to accompany Matthew.
<br>
<br>
<b></b>Manuels results show he is practical, ability to take-charge. He is described as practical, hard working, enjoys leading, self-confident. Manuel sounds like a great team member for all round work and would not be afraid to take charge of a situation.

    <b>Differences Between The Jobs:</b>

<p style="margin-left: 1%">
    Manuels ideal job of a 'IT Security Officer' is a highly technical role in which his work would be of high importance, and most likely high value to its company. This is due to the fact that the security and privacy of a companys data is vital. Indi's role of a 'UI/UX Designer' is on more of a creative area of IT, instead of protecting data he would be involved in creating data in the form of design of apps and websites. Adams role differs from both as he is developing and deploying applications for the company, this differs from Indi's role as Indi would be possibly designing these apps, although it is common knowledge that the developer always has a higher level of design input that anyone else. Adam's role also differs from Manuels role as one of an IT Security Officers responsibilities would be the protection and security for these apps. Finally Matthew's role of a 'Project Manager' differs from all of these roles as he would be in a management field. Project Managers are vital to all our roles, it just depends on what projects he is manageing. He would be responsible for all the backend of our work and making sure that we succeed and deliver with the available resources and time frame.
