    <h2>Group Processes and Communications</h2>
             <p style="margin-left: 1%">
Cinco group communicated through our Discord Server. This allowed us to communicate on an ongoing basis, as one channel acted as a message board for personal updates and discussion about the assignment, while another would act as a place to proof read other members work. There was communication between at least 2 of the members of the group every second day or so during the first weeks of the assignment and then everyone, everyday during the last week.<br>
<br>
Our group was good at communicating downtime in advance and being aware of each-other’s scheduling issues and other commitments that had to come before the project.

Cinco Group, as we have manifested in Assignment 2, really jell well. We work cohesively despite not being on the same place at the same time. We tick all the objectives we set out in order to achieve our goal. We have a working open communication tool where we can discuss, follow through and track development of our given task.
<br><br>
If there’s something that we can improve on, I think, as we have pointed out in Assignment 2, is to include voice communication. I think including voice communication is necessary to eliminate any degree of confusion or misunderstanding.
<br><br>
One thing surprising working with Cinco Group is the absence of dispute among us.  It is a given fact that instances of disputes or misunderstandings do occur in working in a group. There will always be instances that members of a group will bang heads with one another. But surprisingly, we do not have this drama in our group.
<br><br>
If there’s one thing I’ve learned working with this group, that would be once every member of the group is on the same head space and focused on the same end goals, no matter where every member of the group is on a given time, we can successfully achieve our goals without any drama. We can work cohesively, and we can produce the best product we can aim for.

Because of my health issues, I had an extremely tough time getting myself to do the work. I felt I was letting the team down by not getting the work done which I think motivated me to push myself the extra mile and complete the prototype before the final submission. The group did suffer as everyone was dealing with personal commitments that were unavoidable, however once we started working it came together smoothly. Discord has proven to be a very effective collaboration tool, limited only by the file size cap. We got around this with OneDrive. I was surprised by the interest shown by the group in the outcome and was also surprised by my own sense of accomplishment.<br><br>
For me, what went well with this group was the way that everyone came together to complete the work efficiently when we needed to. But an improvement that I would like to make for any future group work would be to make sure work begins earlier and people know everything they need to do ahead of time. I have learned things about myself through this course, one of them being that I succumb to stress easily. Periods of non-communication between members tend to make me very nervous, but again, the group pulled through admirably when I needed them to and I’m happy this is the group I ended up in.<br><br><br>

Overall, I would say that as a group we all worked well enough to get the tasks completed to a high standard. It can be challenging to organize group work when it is been done in an online format, but I feel we overcame those issues and worked well. One idea that allowed our group to work well, was that once we defined roles in terms of what needed to be done and who was accountable for what, we were able to progress and get the assignment completed. This is something I will remember for future group work in not only my studies, but in the workplace as well or any other form of group work. Our group used a discord channel to collaborate and share work or ideas and I feel it was a highly successful method of doing so. I feel it would truly represent that we worked well and evenly distributed work amongst everyone so that the workload was shared and so that we got the most out of each other as individuals. It was disappointing that one of our group members left the group towards the start of the semester, thereby leaving the rest of us each to do more work. However, I feel the remaining four of us have gelled well in a way that has allowed us to still complete all required work to a high standard.

 We worked well again in Assessment task 3. We are only 4 members and we have done a lot of hard work together. The flexibility of working together online means we can jump in and do the work when each of us are available and keep a chat history of what has and needs to be done. To improve we could have voice communication, but I think at this stage we are all fine working without it, I think if we got given a bigger task, we might then start to do voice chats. Again, as in Assignment 2, I was surprised that we worked so well together and were able to create a project efficiently and smoothly together. As these are my first group project tasks that I have done without physically being with my team members I feel now that working with this approach is more efficient. This would be since it is more flexible, you can work on the project when you are not tired and when you are motivated, sharing information is easy and as IT students I feel that we all have the same view on this.<br><br>

<b>Group Cinco</b><br><br>
The consensus among our group is that we have worked very well together over the course of this assignment. Our delegation of tasks worked quite well again, and the project came together in a good quality way.
<br><br>
It is difficult to show evidence of work through discord. But the picture to the right demonstrates our team using this medium to communicate with each other and share files, ideas and links and ensure everyone is on the same page through the user of mentions, which can be targeted to a user or everyone on the server.
<br><br>
Once again, the group had to deal with several obstacles to the successful submission of this assignment.
<br><br>
Personal health issues, prior scheduling commitments and other personal and work commitments made the time we had to work on this assignment strict. Some other groups had 6 or more people to complete their reports and prototypes and we had only 4. Still, we are confident that our idea is interesting and functional, and we all feel that it is an excellent idea for a product for, perhaps a raspberry Pi reseller to offer if all licensing is in order.
