    <b>Interview with Johnathon Rider, Full stack developer<br>
        The Red Cross Army</b>

    <b>•	What kind of work do you do? </b>
        <br>
 

         <p style="margin-left: 1%">
      “I work as a full stack developer with The Red Cross, meaning I am responsible for all areas of development of web products from the back end including the databases, to the front end including the graphical user interface. I use a whole range of programs and languages to do this including SQL for databases, HTML, JavaScript, PHP and many others depending on the task at hand. The work and maintenance of systems is completed in teams where we can collaborate on ideas and share practices that make doing our job easier.”

            <b>•	What kinds of people do you interact with? Other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</b>  
        <br>
 

         <p style="margin-left: 1%">
“I predominantly work with other IT professionals, such as the people in my team, or my supervisors and some of them are IT professionals and some are business professionals who are experienced in leading teams.  Occasionally we will have meetings with clients that will explain a task that they need to be completed but most of the time these tasks are sent and distributed amongst the teams”

<b>•	Where do you spend most of your time at work? </b>
        <br>
         <p style="margin-left: 1%">
 “I spend most days in the office on a full-time basis. The office is more laid back than a normal corporate setting, there is always lots of conversation and ideas being shared and the dress code is more relaxed. There is sometimes a chance to work from home, depending on the task that is being completed and I always take those chances if they come up.”

<b>•	What aspect of your position is most challenging? </b>
        <br>
         <p style="margin-left: 1%">
 “I guess the most challenging part of the role is the need to always be learning about new technology and languages that are required to do the job. Although there are similarities in languages when they are designed for a specific purpose, it is quite often that I will need to spend some time learning the syntax of the language and may also need to spend time learning some of the more specific features of the language so that I can complete the required task at hand. Some other challenges that I face day to day are interpreting what the desired outcome of the task is meant to be. It can be difficult to produce work that meets the expectations of leaders in the team and meets the scope of the project. A way to make this easier is to gather as much information as possible on the task and make informed decisions about what needs to be done.”
