<b><br>Having looked at the Burning Glass Data, has your opinion of you ideal job changed? Why or why not?</b><p style="margin-left: 1%">
<b>Adam: </b>My opinion towards the idea of working as a full stack developer has not changed, but ultimately, I am not certain as to what area of IT I would like to build a career around. Being in a role such as a full stack developer allows for a wholistic set of skills where the person needs to be able to do many different types of things and work with different technologies to create solutions. Although as seen in the Burning Glass data, there is less of a demand for full stack developers compared to other roles I would believe that the skills are highly transferrable and therefore, if I was skilled as full stack developer, I would easily be able to adapt and learn anything required to fulfil a role that was in high demand. 
 <br><br>
One of the high in demand roles was a front-end developer, being a full stack developer would mean that I would have the base knowledge to move into a front-end development role and then could undertake independent learning to become more specialized in the role. Some of the technologies listed that are trending being SQL or java for example, would be languages that a full stack developer has experience with, or with similar languages that would allow for smooth transition into the more popular technology. I feel working towards being a full stack developer is still a great career plan as businesses continue the trend of moving their operations onto computer systems and they will continue to embrace technology as a vital piece of their organizations. If I were to have skills in a wide range of areas, such as what is required by a full stack developer, I feel I would be secure for employment both presently and moving into the future as a reliance on artificial intelligence develops and processing power grows. 
 <br><br>

<b>Indi: </b>
      I was actually surprised that my role stood at position 99 in demanding roles, my initial prediction was that it would not be on the list at all and that all the other jobs that my group members chose would be above mine. Looking at our groups general skills we have a lot that are high ranked, these are all also skills that my job would require. I would not say that the data specifically has changed my ideal job, but rather it has made me want this job more.
      <br><br>

<b>Manuel: </b>According to the Burning Glass Data my job title only ranked 170th out of the 200 listed on demand jobs but this didn’t change my opinion of my ideal job. I chose this job because it is something that I’m passionate about.  I believe that you find more satisfaction and fulfillment on job that you have passion for, and you enjoy doing.  Saying that, I believe though that in the near future demands for IT Security experts will increase exponentially.<br><br>

<b>Matthew: </b>After looking at the Industry data, Project Manager is not listed among the top 200 in demand Job Titles. This is surprising to me, given rumors I have heard firsthand from people who work in the field. But the data doesn’t lie. The interesting thing is that the actual skillset of a project manager is highly in demand. I can only speculate as to what this means to the field. Perhaps in future, project management will be delegated to all members of a team for self-management, or perhaps there will be a spike in the demand for project managers in future as IT projects increase in scale. 
My thoughts on aiming for the Job. Since the ranking is so low it is assumed the Job is not in high demand. This means that competition for these positions would be extremely fierce, especially given their high paying nature.
